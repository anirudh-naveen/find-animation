Bug Fixes -

1. Fix the loading time when clicking on relationship content. ✅
    - When clicking on a relationship content and backtracking on the web, it does not go back to the search but stays on the same screen. This may be a clue into the fact that the system thinks its switching pages but it is not displaying such a switch.
2. Fix the duplication of content (is it Tmdb?)
3. Fix the accidental deletion of content (in merge or original filtering?)
4. Fix duplication email login ✅
5. Fix the search feature showing content by default. ✅
6. Fix the content hover screen when hovering over a content item ✅
   - show the Content Image to the left
   - have the dropdown for watchlist addition include watching as an option.
7. Fix the watchlist content size in My Watchlist ✅
8. Fix the tabs (Home, Movies, TV Shows, etc) to have icons when the screen is small (like on phone dimensions). ✅
9. Fix population of ratings from APIs. ✅
    - There should be three sources of ratings (MAL, TMDB, and FINDANIMATION). Those three should have number of raters and each rating score under each content. 
    - Some of those will not have all three, or even two of the three to contribute to the rating. 
    - Add the numbers of voters together and weight the ratings in the avergae shown accordingly.
10. Fix filter of ratings displaying proper values in search. ✅
    - Right now for example, filtering between 3-7 is including ratings of 8.0.
11. Even out the filters. ✅
